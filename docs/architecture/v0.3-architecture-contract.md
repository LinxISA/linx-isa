# LinxISA v0.3 Architecture Contract

This document is the public architecture contract for the block-structured Linx Instruction Set Architecture (LinxISA) v0.3.
It replaces legacy bring-up notes and is aligned with the check26 contract gate.

## Scope

- ISA profile: `v0.3` only
- Canonical catalog: `isa/v0.3/linxisa-v0.3.json`
- Canonical golden sources: `isa/v0.3/`

## Architectural Guarantees

1. Block-structured execution is mandatory.
2. Control-flow targets MUST resolve to legal block boundaries.
3. `BSTART.*` / `BSTOP` are **block boundary markers** used for block init/commit and are normative for block lifecycle.
   - Interpreting “no architectural instructions outside blocks” for bring-up: there must be **no instructions that modify architectural state outside block execution** (boundary markers/descriptors are allowed as control/packaging mechanisms).
4. Template blocks (`FENTRY`, `FEXIT`, `FRET.*`, `ESAVE`, `ERCOV`) are architected contracts.
5. Decoupled block execution requires legal header descriptors and `B.TEXT` body linkage.
6. Privileged state and trap envelopes are defined by the v0.3 SSR and TRAPNO model.
7. Memory ordering and tile-memory behaviors follow the v0.3 catalog + manual definitions.

## Conformance Gate

The normative gate is `check26`:

```bash
python3 tools/bringup/check26_contract.py --root .
```

All public compiler/emulator/RTL integration updates MUST preserve this contract.
